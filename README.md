### DefaultPanel (Rhino5+Rhino6)
We have scripts shared by several users and sometimes people overwrite the values in the panels and other people forget what the default values were.

With this little snippet you can connect a source and a target panel using right click. If you double click on the component it will copy content to the target.

### HOWTO
Insert DefaultPanel to your grasshopper file. Link default values and a run button through grasshopper wires as usual.
Right click on the DefaultPanel and connect to target panel.
To update, change button to true or double click on DefaultPanel.

USE AT OWN RISK!
